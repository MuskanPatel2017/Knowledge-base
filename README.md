STEPS TO RUN LOCALLY

BACKEND - 

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start


FRONTEND - 

1. Npm install
2. npm run dev


NOTE - 
* Currently the next app will hit the deployed url for strapi, To run in local we need to only run the next app. 
* If we run both the frontend and backend in local then we need to create the data for the 1st time on the strapi admin portal.
* The next app is also deployed so we can directly run the deployed frontend and backend url.
